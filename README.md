### Removed / Deprecated

This "tutorial" was poorly written and filled with terribly incorrect information. Now that I've learned how to do things better, I realize how awful the original instructions were. They were tossed together in an afternoon near the very start of my modding career, and since then I have radically altered the way I approach making/maintaining mod repositories. The information was misleading at best, and horrific to new learners at worst as it taught some very, very bad practices. I felt it unethical to let the original text be left uncommented for any random person to stumble into accidentally, so I'm overwriting it with this commit to hopefully not lead anyone astray.

### Future plans

I'd like to put out a few basic tutorials on getting into modding, designing UI pieces, handling resolution effectively, reasonably effective architecture designs, and some more techniques I've stumbled upon in my brief career in writing Spire code. I don't currently have the time to spend on it, so unfortunately this stuff will probably die with me :(

### Getting the old stuff back

The previous text of this tutorial exists in the commit history in Github if you really want to seek it out. (But again: be warned as it will lead you astray and will probably only confuse newcomers instead of actually provide meaningful help)
